## Development

"Roast and Toast" was developed to be an engaging yet relaxing experience that capitalizes on nostalgia while incorporating modern gameplay mechanics. It's designed for single players, allowing them to explore the storyline at their own pace.

## Objective and Levels

The objective of "Roast and Toast" is simple but captivating: build the best s'mores using the ingredients available. Each level consists of earning points based on how accurately the player can roast, layer, and assemble their s'more within the gameâ??s guidelines. As the levels progress, the combinations get more intricate.

For example, in the first level, players might only need to roast the marshmallow to the right degree of softness. In subsequent levels, they will have to ensure that the marshmallow gets sandwiched between a layer of perfectly melted chocolate and the crispiness of the graham cracker.

This evolving complexity ensures that the game stays fresh and challenging, encouraging players to keep coming back to improve their s'more-making prowess.
